Good morning.  

I spent a good portion of yesterday working on how to publish my blog using obsidian and gothib publisher.  

I think I may have it figured out.  I’ll write about it in my own journal. This is just for practice.

Catherine and me. 


There is more I should say. But I’ll keep this like this for the moment.
