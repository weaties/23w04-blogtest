This is my attempt to figure out how it is that I might use obsidian as my content mangaement system, and then publish it as a static website.  

at the moment I am using a new Vault dedicated to this, with a throw away github repo at the moment.

if I really get good at this, I might be able to make it so that I am able to do a subdirectory of a different vault, but at the moment, being able to manage a dedicated vault might very well do what I need to do.
